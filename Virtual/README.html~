<h1>Virtual Machine Options</h1>

<p>You have several options for installing a virtual machine containing the Econ-ARK tools.</p>

<h2>Easiest</h2>

<p>Install "Docker" on your computer, and follow the instructions in the <a href="">Docker</a> directory to run everything inside a "container" on your computer</p>

<ul>
<li>Docker shares resources with your computer</li>
<li>Your computer's regular operations will sap the performance of the Docker machine</li>
</ul>

<h2>Most Powerful</h2>

<p>Your computer can be (temporarily; reversibly; while booted from the
external USB stick) turned into a Linux-native machine, which makes
its full resources (RAM; processors) available to the software. This
is like a brain transplant for your computer, and is worth doing if
you will be spending a lot of time working with the tools</p>

<ul>
<li>This will require you to have two USB sticks
<ol>
<li>A small one to hold the installer software (say, 4GB)</li>
<li>A large one to hold the installed system (at least 64 GB)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Be sure to get a <em>fast</em> USB stick, at least for the large dive</li>
<li><a href="#MIN-or-MAX">xubark-MIN</a> and <a href="#MIN-or-MAX">xubark-MAX</a> are ISO image files described below</li>
<li>Download them and "burn" them to a USB stick (or CD-ROM)</li>
</ul>

<h2>In-Between</h2>

<p>You can install VirtualBox on your computer, which will allow you to
run Linux in a virtual machine that is encapsulated on your regular
hard drive.  This has the advantage of being very safe (the virtual
machine is completely contained inside a VirtualBox jail; you have to
give it permissions to do everything). It has the disadvantage, like
the Docker solution, of requiring your computer to share its
resources.</p>

<p>It also requires a fair bit of configuration, so there is a separate set 
of instructions:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/econ-ark/econ-ark-tools/tree/master/Virtual/Machine/VirtualBox">econ-ark/econ-ark-tools/Virtual/Machine/VirtualBox</a></p>

<h1>MIN or MAX</h1>

<h3><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yGk_LFM6y3M_Y_8BbYdwoMQ14wGFQPZB?usp=sharing">xubark-MIN</a></h3>

<p>Installs python3, jupyter lab, Econ-ARK, and not much else. The total size
of the software is about 7 GB, so even if you have a fairly small USB
stick you should be able to run Econ-ARK stuff on it.</p>

<p>Installation of this machine should take roughly an hour if you have reasonably
fast internet access.</p>

<p>Even if you plan ultimately to install the MAX version described below, you might
do a "test run" with the MIN version because it is considerably faster.</p>

<h3><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OarYGCwW4Avc1UMpPHsIMWr4jh0tKUn6?usp=sharing">xubark-MAX</a></h3>

<p>In addition to the contents of <a href="#xubark-MIN">xubark-MIN</a>, the MAX version includes a full installation of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Anaconda 3</li>
<li>LaTeX</li>
<li>QuantEcon</li>
<li>scipy</li>
</ol>

<p>and a suite of other tools that together construct a machine that
should be adequate for a rich variety of tasks for scientific
computation. Indeed, the VM can run code (installed) that reproduces
the full results of several computational economics papers.</p>

<p>This machine is considerably larger, and so will take longer to install, perhaps
several hours.</p>

<h2>Instructions for Installing your VM</h2>

<h3><a href="#burn">Burn</a> your chosen ISO image (MIN or MAX) to the small USB stick</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download your selected (MIN or MAX) ISO image to your computer</li>
<li><p>"mount" the image so that the computer can see it</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-USB-stick-On-Windows">Create-A-USB-Stick-On-Windows</a></p>

<ul>
<li>I don't have a Windows machine so can't debug this</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>On Macs, mounting is done with the Disk Utility app ("open image")</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://bombich.com/ccc5/how-does-free-30-day-trial-work">"Carbon Copy Cloner"</a> is the most reliable option 
<ul>
<li>Format your USB stick to MS-DOS</li>
<li>Clone from the mounted ISO image to the formatted USB stick</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://unetbootin.github.io">UNETBOOTIN</a>
<ul>
<li>If you use this, you need FIRST to</li>
<li>Format your USB drive (using Disk Utility) as MS-DOS</li>
<li>Mount the USB drive on your computer</li>
<li>Then run the unetbootin app and choose "Drive Image"</li>
<li>Navigate to wherever you have downloaded your ISO</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://balena.io/etcher/">"Etcher"</a>
<ul>
<li>Seems to work on 2015-2019 vintage macs</li>
<li>Fails on some earlier and later ones</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macs">Create-A-USB-Stick-On-Macs</a> is another resource</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3>Boot your computer from the USB stick</h3>

<ol>
<li>Macs:
<ul>
<li>Hold the "option" key when the compute is booting</li>
<li>Depending on your model, you will see one of
<ul>
<li>"ARKINSTALL"</li>
<li>"EFI BOOT"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pick whichever of these options you see</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Windows:
<ul>
<li>The steps to boot from an external drive depend on your model
<ul>
<li>There are lots of tutorials on the web</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3>Do Not Destroy Your Real Computer!</h3>

<p>When you boot from the installer USB stick, the first question you are likely to be asked is whether you want to "unmount active partitions." The answer is yes -- the only "active partitions" should be those on the booted USB stick, and you don't want it to write over itself</p>

<p>The next question you will need to answer is where you want to install the system.</p>

<p>There are a number of options, but you should pick "entire disk"</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't worry, it won't wipe your computer's drive clean</li>
<li>Instead it will ASK you which of the available drives you want to use</li>
<li>One of them should have a name corresponding to the large USB stick. Pick that.</li>
<li>You will then be asked a couple of further questions
<ul>
<li>Just hit "enter" or choose "yes" repeatedly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The last question is whether you want to write the new partioning schemes 
<ul>
<li>It will show your USB stick's partitioning scheme</li>
<li>It will ALSO show your computer's drive partitioning scheme </li>
<li>Don't worry, it won't actually do anything to your computer's scheme
<ul>
<li>So, say "yes"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Wait</h3>

<p>The installation proceeds in two stages:</p>

<ol>
<li>Constructing the basic Linux operating system and GUI</li>
<li>Adding supplemental materials
<ul>
<li>Like Econ-ARK</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>The machine will reboot a couple of times during this process. If necessary, you may need to coax your computer to reboot from the right drive (the new one!)</p>

<h3>Enjoy!</h3>

<p>The result should be a fully functional installation of Linux from which you can boot your computer. In fact, on the first boot, it should automatically login as:</p>

<p>username: econ-ark</p>

<p>password: kra-noce</p>

<p>PS. Since this username and password are publicly available on the net, you should make sure that you do not store sensitive personal information on the virtual machine.</p>
